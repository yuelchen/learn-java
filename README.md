# explore-java-api-library
This repository is a collection of Java examples or simple projects in using the built-in Java api library.

### Scanner
A java utility for obtaining input for primitive types and Strings; see below two projects for source examples:
- [GuessingGames](https://github.com/yuelchen/explore-java-api-library/tree/master/GuessingGames/src/com/yuelchen): a simple (number) guessing game where the user provides the system a range from which it can pick a random number. The user is then allowed to guess the random number the system generated and once correctly guessed, the system will return with the count of guesses made. 
- [IntroScanner](https://github.com/yuelchen/explore-java-api-library/tree/master/IntroScanner/src/com/yuelchen/main): a list of input prompts for retrieving String and primitive types (i.e. boolean, int, long and double) from within main method in the form of a survey and then returns summary at the end. 

### Properties
A java utility for loading, adding, removing and storing configuration properties. 
This allows configuration properties to be driven through an external file rather than hard coded values - leading to release changes being configuration dependent rather than code dependent. 
- [IntroProperties](https://github.com/yuelchen/explore-java-api-library/tree/master/IntroProperties/src/com/yuelchen/main): a list of Properties operations such as loading properties file, adding property, removing property (if it exists) and storing properties to a file.
